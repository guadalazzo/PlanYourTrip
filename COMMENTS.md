Please answer these questions once you have finished the assignment.

**What did you think of the assignment?**

I really liked since I had the opportunity of create a image component with a lot of optimization. I haven't used Imgix before.

**Which part did you consider the most difficult, or did you spend most of your time on?**

Optimizing the app to hit a green score in lighthouse.
Mainly in Perfomance and accesibility.

**Which parts were you not able to fully implement?**

I wanted to add github pipeline for CI/CD but I need to make the repository public for it.

**What would you add or improve if you had more time?**

I added in the readme a list of all the things that could be implemented if this is becomes a scale up aplication.The list is not order by priority

[If this app grows it needs]

- Adding metatags opengraph for SEO translated for each country

- Including i18n for handling translations

- react-router if it has more routes

- Connecting the error boundary to some tool for logging errors

- e2e tests

- Including tracking

- Handling production/dev secret keys for example for API urls.

- More test coverage

- Configure pipeline for CI/CD

**What would you do differently if it was a bigger application?**

Probably also answered with previous question but

Connect to a real API.

I would create a component library with design system

Separate the types per functionality

Split the service per page

I would consider using Redux or react-query as a state managment tool

Add a coverage percentage before pushing.

I would have worked with branches and name that belongs to the ticket.

styles.css per page and component to group styles
